(R studio implementation of linear regression model to predict average life expectancy of people)

Each and everything we see around us has an expiration date, humans are no exception either. we also have a cartain period of life span which vary from person to person on the basis of race, ethnicity, family medical history, lifestyle etc. The entire list of these kind of factors is very large which makes it very difficult to understand which factors are affecting the average life expectancy of people more severly. However, with ongoing advancements in machine learning and data science, we can do it easily and can also precisely predict the same given the essential parameters.

Using R studio, I have deployed linear regression model to achieve this. AFter data analysis, training the model and getting a good accuracy it was observed that - 

1. Life expectancy and adult mortality rates have high negative correlation which means reaching 15 yrs of age does not ensure a good life ahead if one does not take care of his/her healthy habits
2. organization like WHO ( World health organization ) can keep track of the life expectancy of people by observing factors like adult mortality rate, vaccines doses, issues of HIV & AIDS, Income composition of resource and schooling rather than observing factors like country, year, expenditure etc.
3. Not suprisingly schooling years have high positive correlation with life expectancy because schooling leads to adoption of healthy habits and discipline
4. A country's GDP and income composition  affect life expectancy more broadly. So including these factors government should also focus on vaccination, Per capita GDP and  education to improve the country in terms of life expectancy
5. One can extend their life span by adopting a healthy lifestyle, having proper body is to mass ratio, proper education, and getting vaccinated on time for each disease
6. Average life expectancy of people over the years in different countries is 69 yrs which is good but can be better by adopting healthy habits
7. Some parameters like pollution and environmental index are missing in the data but can be included to get more insight into the factors affecting life expectancy
